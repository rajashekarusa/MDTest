| [AddToCache(WebAPIContext)](OfficeDevPnP.Core.WebAPI.WebAPIHelper.10fa47cc.md) | Uses the information regarding the requesting app to obtain an access token and caches that using the cachekey. This method is called from the Register WebAPI service api.
| [GetClientContext(HttpControllerContext)](OfficeDevPnP.Core.WebAPI.WebAPIHelper.291cca75.md) | Creates a ClientContext token for the incoming WebAPI request. This is done by - looking up the servicesToken - extracting the cacheKey - get the AccessToken from cache.
